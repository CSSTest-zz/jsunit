      <h2>Standard Tests using Autodiscovery</h2>

      <p><a href="jsUnitAutoDiscoveryTestsIndex.html">jsUnitAutoDiscoveryTestsIndex.html</a></p>

      <p>
      A Test Suite which runs internal tests of jsUnit.
      These tests use the ability of jsUnit to discover test names
      which begin with 'test' and to automatically execute them. 
      </p>

      <p>
      This is
      not possible in all browsers. 
      If your browser does not support
      test auto-discovery, please use the other version of these tests
      which expose the names of test functions through a function which
      returns an array of test function names
      </p>

    <h2>Standard Tests using Test Declaration</h2>
      <p>
      A Test Suite which runs internal tests of jsUnit.
      These tests use a function which returns an array of test function names
      and may be supported by a larger range of browsers than the autodiscovery
      form of the tests.
