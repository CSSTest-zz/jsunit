Required for 2.2 release:

  FEATURES:
    - make all logging go through some status logger interface
    - queuing needs work - linkedlist, queue
    - group 3rd party jars and add licenses
    - Send traces back to client (IN PROGRESS - ehanson)
    - surround tracing with pre tags (maybe CDATA if the trace is XML?)
    - stack traces for failures
    - make DT not need 2 configurations

  BUGS:
    - Mozilla 1.7.12 issues
    - Some tests don't run in Konqueror; there's a hang in the onload test
    - SourceForge bugs
    - IE7beta issues - query strings not possible for file:/// protocol - is it a bug in IE7?

Future releases:
  FEATURES:
    - individual testFunction= parameter to testRunner.html that makes it run only that test function
    - EXTERNALLY_SHUT_DOWN browser result type
    - make setUpPageStatus='complete' better (at least a function you can just call when you are done setting up the page)
    - warning (i.e. a failure of some kind) when no tests found

  REFACTORINGS:
    - better ashcroft compliance
