jsunit
------
REQUIRED:
distributed test should be able to take the URL parameter
refactor testrunresult, browserresult, testpageresult and testcaseresult so they inherit and implement some interface; make each add a type="SUCCCESS" element to the root node
IE7beta issues
shouldLog on configuration should turn of *all* logging
support for multiple server clients/queuing
jsunit source div innerHTML

NICE-TO-HAVE
have the config servlet show each remote server's configuraion (could cache it)
individual testFunction= parameter to testRunner.html that makes it run only that test function
"retry test run" immediately fails after a test page timeout
EXTERNALLY_SHUT_DOWN browser result type (tests are currently x'ed out)


eclipse plugin
--------------
REQUIRED:

NICE-TO-HAVE:
checkmark/error icon on jsunit tab after run is finished
tab title should go italic during test run
validate no duplicate browser entries are given in preferences
rerun button
ability to go to source by double-clicking on stack trace
ability to toggle between fully qualified and not fully qualified browser name
