Core JsUnit
-----------
Required for next release:
- IE7beta issues
- jsunit source div innerHTML
- bug: "retry test run" immediately fails after a test page timeout
- Don't send System.err to a file - figure out how to turn off jetty logs instead
- update website
- Distributed test should bring up a farm server

Backlog:
- individual testFunction= parameter to testRunner.html that makes it run only that test function
- EXTERNALLY_SHUT_DOWN browser result type (tests are currently x'ed out)
- SourceForge bugs

Eclipse plugin
--------------
Required for next release:

Backlog:
- rerun button
- prevent simultaneous runs
- checkmark/error icon on jsunit tab after run is finished
- tab title should go italic during test run
- validate no duplicate browser entries are given in preferences
- ability to go to source by double-clicking on stack trace
- break plugin code into separate project?
