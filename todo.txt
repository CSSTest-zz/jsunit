Required for next release:

    - queuing needs work
    - choice of multiple remote browsers & multiple remote machines
    - keep original names & place in temporary uniquely named subdirectories
    - remove all files with an around interceptor
    - uploaded test suites
    - Send traces back to client (IN PROGRESS - ehanson)
    - finish Text.xsl

--------------------
    - jsUnitCore.js (line 239): assignment to undeclared variable assertArrayEquals

jsUnitCore.js (line 231): test for equality (==) mistyped as assignment (=)?
if (isEqual = (var1.length === var2.length))

This one is solved by adding an extra set of parenthesis.

if ((isEqual = ( var1.length === var2.length)))

To test these start firefox and go to about:config and set
javascript.options.strict to true

---------------
