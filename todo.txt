REQUIRED:
Fix IE7beta issues
shouldLog on configuration should turn of *all* logging

All SourceForge bugs

NICE-TO-HAVE:
checkmark/error icon on jsunit tab after run is finished
tab title should go italic during test run
validate no duplicate browser entries are given in preferences
ability to go to source by double-clicking on stack trace
ability to toggle between fully qualified and not fully qualified browser name
