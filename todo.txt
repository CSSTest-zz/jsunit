Required for next release:
  FEATURES:
    - jsunit source div innerHTML
  REFACTORINGS:
    - make all Result implementers implement XmlRenderable
    - make a "getResultString" on abstractresult that writes "the test failed with x errors and y failures" (right now this is duplicated in ST and DT)
  BUGS:
    -- Don't send System.err to a file - figure out how to turn off jetty logs instead
    - look at all jsunit emails to see what feature requests/bugs there are to do
  WEBSITE/DOCUMENTATION
    - documentation of assertArrayEquals
    - documentation of assertHTMLEquals
    - documentation of assertEvaluatesToFalse & assertEvaluatesToTrue
    - xsl file for generating jsunit.properties.sample

keith's stuff:

* distributedtest as multiple individual runs
*       Wait for 120 seconds for each test page to load (rather than 20
seconds), and 120 seconds for setUpPage to be called (rather than 60
seconds).

Backlog:
- individual testFunction= parameter to testRunner.html that makes it run only that test function
- EXTERNALLY_SHUT_DOWN browser result type (tests are currently x'ed out)
- SourceForge bugs
- IE7beta issues
