Required for next release:
- IE7beta issues
- jsunit source div innerHTML
- bug: "retry test run" immediately fails after a test page timeout
-- Don't send System.err to a file - figure out how to turn off jetty logs instead
- update website
- look at all jsunit emails to see what feature requests/bugs there are to do
- configuration xml should be specific to the server type
- browserfilenames shouldn't be required for distributed_test target

Backlog:
- individual testFunction= parameter to testRunner.html that makes it run only that test function
- EXTERNALLY_SHUT_DOWN browser result type (tests are currently x'ed out)
- SourceForge bugs
